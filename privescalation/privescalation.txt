• Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.

- In insecure.js, in the /update-role endpoint, we do not have any authentication
 mechanism to verify the user's identity. So, we should add strong authentication mechanism.

• What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such
attacks?

- We can add a strong authentication mechanism like 2FA.
