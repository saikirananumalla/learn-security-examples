- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation
 than the insecure version.

The insecure.js has a vulnerability that will result in non-repudiation since we cannot determine
 the user who performed the action. This is primarily due to not logging the user details in the actions.
The secure.js removes this issue by adding a middleware to log the incoming request details.
It also adds the user details in the log streams.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

- We can add authentication mechanisms to avoid tampering the log file. We can maintain copies.
