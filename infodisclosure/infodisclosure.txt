Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?

The insecure script does not sanitize the username which could allow an injection attack.
User can provide the username as a query such as username!='' which could return information for all users.
To avoid this, secure.js script performs sanitization on username that we receive from the client.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

- Remove the console logs which logs sensitive information.
- Add authentication mechanism
- When sending information, we can encrypt the payload.
