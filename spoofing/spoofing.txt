Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability in insecure.js is due to its permission for setting session information
 due to the absence of cookie.httpOnly being set to false. This can cause malicious
users to exploit session hijacking or execute Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
The fix this, we need to set cookie.httpOnly is set to true, which restricts unauthorized
 access to session data and preventing attacks.
