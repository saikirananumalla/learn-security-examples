- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The script inside insecure.js is vulnerable because there is no error handling when querying
the DB. So, if an error occurs the server will crash and will not be accessible causing a denial
of service.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
1. Add a rate limiting mechanism because even though error handling mechanism is present, the server
is still be DDOS attacked and would crash.
2. Add input sanitization for other incoming parameters.
